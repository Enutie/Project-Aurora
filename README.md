Hey there! üëã

Welcome to Project Aurora, my personal journey into becoming a better developer. This project is all about creating a web app where I can playtest my Magic: The Gathering (MTG) decks against an AI. If you're into MTG or just love coding projects, you're in the right place!

## What's Inside?

- **Aurora**: The brains of the operation, written in C#.
- **Aurora.Frontend**: The face of the project, made with Vue.js.
- **Aurora.Tests**: Where I make sure everything works as expected.

## Why Am I Doing This?

I love MTG and I want to sharpen my dev skills. Combining the two seemed like the perfect challenge. Plus, who doesn't want to beat an AI with their own deck, right?

## Want to Help?

I'd love your input and advice! I'm still learning and would really appreciate any tips or contributions. Fork this repo, make some changes, and send over a pull request. Let‚Äôs make this awesome together.

## MVP Iterations: Exploring the Magic! üåü

Let's sketch out some ideas for MVP iterations in Project Aurora. I'm stepping into the unknown, learning as I go! üÉè

### Iteration 1: Diving In

- **Objective:** Let's dip our toes into the world of Magic, one step at a time.
- **What I'm Dreaming Of:**
  - I'm thinking of starting with basic lands and vanilla creatures.
  - Maybe I'll try out some basic combat moves to get a feel for things.
- **What I Might See:** Expect a simple introduction to Magic: The Gathering. We'll touch on different card types and maybe even dip into the stack mechanic, if I'm feeling adventurous!

### Dreaming Up Future Iterations

As I tiptoe forward, I'm dreaming of exploring different card types like instants, sorceries, and creatures. I might even peek into the mysterious world of the stack mechanic. Join me on this journey of discovery! üöÄ
